After completing this project, I was successful in learning and implementing the basic and
some complex concepts of object oriented programming c++ in developing a simulated Assembly
Line. I learned the basic concpets of starting and developing the project by integrating and
linking the various independent and dependent modules.

I also learned the importance and implementation of containers, especially concepts regarding
vector and deque. I understand the working of the given project and implemented the logic
of the code accordingly.

There were two phases where it took a lot of time consumption. The first phase was in milestone2
where I faced lots of difficulty in memory leaks which was occcuring in move assignment operator
which was solved eventually by repeating debugging the code. The second phase was regarding the 
sequence of order filling in milestone 3 where the output was coming correctly but in improper
order which took quite a lot time in assembling the logic depending on the vector and deque containers.

Overall, I learned many useful things during and after completing this project.
